    "1. Data Understanding:\n",
    "    - Explore the structure of the dataset, including features like review text, star ratings, and business categories.\n",
    "        Understand the distribution of star ratings and sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative) in the dataset.\n",
    "      \n",
    "2. Text Preprocessing:\n",
    "    - Tokenization: Split the tweets into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "    - Removing stopwords: Eliminate common words that don't carry much sentiment information.\n",
    "    - Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form to reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "    - Handle mentions, hashtags, and URLs: Remove or replace mentions, hashtags, and URLs with placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Extraction:\n",
    "    - Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represent text data as a matrix of word frequencies.\n",
    "    - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weigh the importance of words in a document relative to their frequency in the corpus.\n",
    "    - Word Embeddings: Represent words in a continuous vector space, such as Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Building:\n",
    "    - Algorithms: Use algorithms suitable for text classification\n",
    "        - Naive Bayes\n",
    "        - Logistic Regression\n",
    "        - Support Vector Machines\n",
    "        - Neural network-based models like LSTM or CNN.\n",
    "    - Train/Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets, typically using an 80/20 or 70/30 split.\n",
    "   - Model evaluation:\n",
    "       - Accuracy\n",
    "       - Precision\n",
    "       - Recall\n",
    "       - F1-score\n",
    "       - ROC-AUC\n",
    "5. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "    - Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for each model.\n",
    "    - Perform cross-validation with k-fold to ensure robustness of parameter selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "    - Evaluate the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "    - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization performance of the models.\n",
    "    - Visualize model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Analysis of Results:\n",
    "    - Examine misclassified examples: Analyze misclassified tweets to understand common errors made by the model.\n",
    "    - Interpret feature importance: If using models like Logistic Regression or linear SVM, analyze feature coefficients or weights to understand which words contribute most to sentiment classification.\n",
    "    - Optionally, analyze sentiment trends across different business categories or locations within the dataset."
